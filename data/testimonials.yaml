    I’ve tried massage services in many places around the world – from Latin America to Southeast Asia – yet nothing compares to the quality and sense of wellbeing I experience with her. She has that rare combination of skill, intuition and tranquility that makes each session truly restorative.
    Highly recommended to anyone looking for an exceptional massage experience"

    Всички в офиса чакаме с нетърпение масажите си в нейното кътче за релакс с приятна музика, ароматни свещи и усещане за спокойствие.\n
    Тя е изключително мила, с невероятна енергия, и превръща тези 15 минути масаж в истинска почивка и презареждане!"

Beyond her skill and professionalism, she has a warm, calming and personal approach to every client of hers - from the atmosphere she creates with peaceful sounds and scents from her handmade candles, to adapting her technique according to the needs of the person.\n

  text: "Възползвам се от масажите на Стели от много години в офиса на Инфраджистикс, където работя. Като фен на масажите, мога спокойно да кажа, че тя е от най-добрите масажисти, ако не и най-добрия (обичм често да ползвам масажи по спа центрове и правя сравнение).\n\n
      Стели използва техники, които не съм усещал от други масажисти, но по-важното е, че тези техники яко облекчават и енергизирят тялото. При Стели няма излишни движения, които само губят време и не носят нищо, няма нескопосани движения, техниката й за мен е превъзходна. В комбинация със невероятна сила в пръстите и китките.\n\n
      Професионализмът на Стели е на много високо ниво - единственият масажист, който съм виждал, че от началото до края на масажа, няма в момент, в който да няма досег с клиента. Дори при смяна на позицията си например, едната ръка остава постоянно в контакт с тялото на клиента - това знам че е много висок професионализъм и лична отговорност към нивото, което поддържа.\n\n
      Масажът при Стели е много приятно и тонизиращо изживяване - и за тялото, и за ума."

      Steli has an exceptional technique and remarkable physical strength it always felt as if she never ran out of energy. Even in a short 30-minute session, she managed to make me feel both physically and emotionally recharged. Beyond her skills, she is also very pleasant to communicate with always patient, respectful, and composed. She also maintains excellent hygiene and creates a calm, welcoming atmosphere, which adds to the overall positive experience.\n\n
      Now that Steli is developing her own massage studio, I am confident she will be very successful. Based on my personal experience as her client, I can wholeheartedly recommend her to anyone seeking a dedicated, talented, and trustworthy massage therapist."
